### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer based in Calbayog City, Samar, Philippines.

I've been dabbling in code since my dad showed me BASIC in my childhood. I made a few a few terminal games and even a little contacts application in Visual Basic when I got the hang of it!

In my teenage years I managed to come accross the online game platfrom ROBLOX, where I spent a lot of time making games and scripting them in Lua. After that came Minecraft - which I also managed to get into trying out different mods and editing them in Java.

Although back then I would always dream of becoming a game developer - nothing has come of it so far. Who knows what could become of the future, though?

Now, since 2019, I am mainly a PHP & Javascript engineer with a passion for DevOps. Some of my favorite things are;

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
- [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

If you have any projects that need an extra hand - or just need some advice on deployment and architecture - hit me up and I'll be happy to contribute what I can.

Let's learn ðŸ”­ and build ðŸ‘· great things together! âœ¨
